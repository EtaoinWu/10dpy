# 10dpy - 10 Digit Pinyin

10dpy is an phono-coding scheme of Standard Mandarin Chinese. It uses 10 bits (binary **digits**) to encode a Standard Chinese syllable, and each of these bits can be input by a **digit** of the hand. This is loosely inspired by rime's [Combo Pinyin](https://github.com/rime/rime-combo-pinyin). The reference implementation works with the steno engine [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover), and is supposed to be used **with another full-Pinyin IME**.

          #  Y  y         w  W  :
